## Theme Song

* *Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburg*

* *Racecars, lasers, aeroplanes, it's a duck blur*

* *Might solve a mystery, or rewrite history*

* *'DuckTales', woo-oo!*

* *Every day, they're out there making 'DuckTales', woo-oo!*

* *Tales of derring-do, bad and good luck tales! Woo-oo!*

* *D-d-d-danger lurks behind you!*

* *There's a stranger out to find you!*

* *What to do, just grab onto some 'DuckTales'! Woo-oo!*

* *Every day, they're out there making 'DuckTales', woo-oo!*

* *Tales of daring, bad and good, not ponytails or cottontails!*

* *No, 'DuckTales'! Woo-oo!*
