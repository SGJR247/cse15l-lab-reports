Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburg

Racecars, lasers, aeroplanes, it's a duck blur

Might solve a mystery, or rewrite history

DuckTales, woo-oo!

Every day, they're out there making DuckTales, woo-oo!

Tales of derring-do, bad and good luck tales! Woo-oo!

D-d-d-danger lurks behind you!

There's a stranger out to find you!

What to do, just grab onto some DuckTales! Woo-oo!

Every day, they're out there making DuckTales, woo-oo!

Tales of daring, bad and good, not ponytails or cottontails!

No, DuckTales! Woo-oo!
